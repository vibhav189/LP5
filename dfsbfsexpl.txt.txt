The code you provided demonstrates the implementation of breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) algorithms for a graph using OpenMP in C++.

The `bfs` function performs a breadth-first search on the given graph. It takes the graph represented as a 2D array `graph`, the starting node `start`, and the ending node `end` as parameters. It initializes an array `visited` to keep track of visited nodes. The function uses a queue to explore the graph in a breadth-first manner. Starting from the `start` node, it visits all adjacent nodes before moving to the next level. The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive parallelizes the loop that processes each level in the queue. Each thread processes a subset of nodes in the current level concurrently. The function updates the `visited` array, pushes unvisited nodes into the queue, and increments the `level` variable to track the current level. The BFS continues until the queue becomes empty or the `end` node is found. The function returns `-1` if the `end` node is not reachable from the `start` node.

The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search on the given graph. It takes the graph represented as a 2D array `graph` and the starting node `node` as parameters. Similar to the `bfs` function, it initializes an array `visited` to keep track of visited nodes. The function uses a stack to explore the graph in a depth-first manner. Starting from the `node`, it explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. The `#pragma omp parallel for` directive parallelizes the loop that processes each level in the stack. Each thread processes a subset of nodes in the current level concurrently. The function updates the `visited` array, pushes unvisited nodes into the stack, and prints the node being visited. The DFS continues until the stack becomes empty.

In the `main` function, a sample graph is created using a 2D array. The graph is represented by adjacency matrix, where `graph[i][j]` is set to `1` if there is an edge between nodes `i` and `j`, and `0` otherwise. The BFS is called with the graph, starting node `0`, and ending node `4`. The DFS is then called with the graph and starting node `0`. The visited nodes are printed to the console.

Overall, the code demonstrates how to implement parallel BFS and DFS algorithms using OpenMP, allowing multiple nodes or levels of the graph to be processed concurrently by different threads.
